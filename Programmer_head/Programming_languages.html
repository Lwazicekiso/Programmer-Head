                <p>The term programming refers to communicating with a computer in order to achieve our desired goal.
                    This could range from analyzing data to creating websites. In today digital world programming is a very
                    important skill because it can be used in any field to make tasks easier, more efficient, and accurate. But
                    how do we partake in this communication do we simply use natural language and speak to computers
                    the way we would with our friends? No, there are multiple far too many factors which make this difficult
                    such as natural language being way too ambiguous and sometimes needing common sense. This is
                    where programming languages come in. Programming languages are tools we use to communicate with </p> 
                </p>
                <h1>Types Of Programming Languages</h1>
              
                <p>Although there are various ways to classify programming languages classifying them according to paradigms, such as Procedural, Object-Oriented, Functional, Scripting, and Logical, is essential for clarity, comprehension, and problem-domain alignment. This classification promotes best practices, modular code, and simplifies collaboration between languages, fostering specialization among developers and encouraging innovation and evolution in programming.

                        <h2>Procedural Programming</h2>
                            <img src="images/images_for_programming_lang/Procedural_programming.png" alt="image displaying an example of procedural code">
                            <p>
                                let's talk about Procedural Programming! Imagine you're in the kitchen, about to bake a delicious cake. Procedural Programming is a lot like following a recipe to bake that cake. It's all about giving clear, step-by-step instructions to a computer to complete a task.
                                
                                In Procedural Programming, we take a linear approach, just like following a recipe from start to finish. We treat the data, like the ingredients, and the instructions, like mixing or baking, as separate things.
                                
                                Instead of having one big set of instructions, we break them down into smaller sets called procedures. These procedures are like mini-tasks, each with their own series of steps. It's kind of like crafting a sandwich â€“ each step, like "take two slices of bread" or "spread peanut butter on one slice," is like a procedure.
                                
                                But that's not all! In Procedural Programming, there are a few key concepts to explore:
                            </p>
                        
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Predefined Functions: These are like specialized instructions that already have names, such as 'cut,' 'mix,' or 'spread.' They are built into the programming language and help us perform common tasks without having to write out all the details each time.
                                    </li> 
                                    <li>Local Variables: Think of these as containers that hold information, but they can only be used within a specific part of the instructions. It's like having a bowl that you can only use in one step of the recipe.
                                    </li> 
                                    <li>Global Variables: These are like bowls or utensils that you can use anywhere in the recipe. They are available for use in all the steps.
                                    </li> 
                                    <li>Modularity: This is a way of organizing our instructions. It's like having different groups of tasks that can be completed one after the other to achieve a bigger goal, just like preparing all the sandwich ingredients before assembling it.
                                    </li> 
                                    <li>Parameter Passing: This is how we can give additional information to our procedures. For example, if you have a step that says "spread jelly," you might need to specify what type of jelly to spread. Parameter passing allows us to do that.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <div class="pro_vs_cons">
                                        <h3>Advantages of Procedural Programming:</h3>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>General-Purpose: Procedural Programming is versatile and can be used for a wide range of tasks.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Simplicity: It's relatively easy to write and understand code in this style, and it works well with compilers and interpreters (tools that convert code into instructions a computer can follow).
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Learning Resources: There are plenty of books and online courses available that teach proven techniques and algorithms, which makes it easier for beginners to learn.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Portability: Code written in this style can be used on different types of computers, which is handy if you want your program to work on various machines.
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>
                                    
                                    5. Code Reusability: You can reuse sections of code in different parts of your program without having to duplicate it, saving time and making your code more organized.
                                <h3>Disdvantages of Procedural Programming:</h3>
                                    
                                    <ol> 
                                        <li>Complexity: As programs get larger and more intricate, writing code in this style can become quite complex.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Limited reusability: When you write code using a procedural approach, it may not be easy to reuse it in different programs, which means you might need to rewrite the code for other uses.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Abstract concepts: It can be hard to link procedural code with real-world objects or ideas, making some tasks more complicated.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Data handling: Procedural programming often puts more emphasis on operations (what the program does) rather than data (the information the program works with). This could cause issues when dealing with sensitive or secure data.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Data exposure: In this coding style, data is available to the entire program, possibly posing security risks in more complex programs.
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>

                            <img src="images/images_for_programming_lang/object-oriented-programming.png" alt="Image displaying some principles  of Objec object-oriented-programming">
                            <p>
                                Now, let's shift gears to the captivating world of <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming" >OOP</abbr>! Brace yourselves for a programming paradigm that's nothing short of revolutionary.
                
                                In OOP, we're not just writing code; we're creating virtual entities called "objects" that have their own unique characteristics and superpowers. These objects take center stage, and it's all about what they can do, rather than how we make them do it.
                                
                                This approach is like a secret weapon for tackling massive, intricate software projects. From crafting manufacturing system simulations to developing cutting-edge mobile apps, OOP's got you covered.
                                
                                But wait, there's more! OOP isn't just about coding; it's a team player. It's fantastic for collaborative development, allowing teams to break down projects into manageable pieces. Plus, it comes with superpowers like code reusability, scalability, and turbocharging efficiency.
                                
                                The adventure begins by identifying all the incredible objects we'll work with and uncovering how they relate to each other â€“ this part is called "data modeling." Objects can be as diverse as real-world people (with names and addresses) or even little software wonders like widgets.
                                
                                Once we've discovered our objects, each one gets a "class" badge, which tells us what kind of data it holds and the cool tricks it can perform (methods). These objects chat with each other using we
                            </p>
                
                        <h3>Main Principles of OOP:</h3>
                            <ol> 
                                <li>Encapsulation: Imagine objects as secretive vaults! In <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming" >OOP</abbr>, we keep all the essential stuff inside objects and only reveal what's needed. Each object's inner workings remain private in a class, safeguarding them from prying eyes. Others can only access a handpicked list of functions, ensuring data security.</li>
                            
                                <li>Abstraction: Abstraction is like an <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming" >OOP</abbr> magic trick! Objects disclose just enough for others to use, concealing the underlying complexity. This approach makes it simpler for developers to modify or introduce new features later on, akin to adding layers to your favorite sandwich.</li>            
                                <li>Inheritance: Picture inheritance as hand-me-downs for classes! It lets classes borrow code from others. Objects can form connections and subclasses, inheriting logic while preserving their distinct identity. It's like building upon existing knowledge, saving time and guaranteeing accuracy.</li>
                            
                                <li>Polymorphism: Visualize objects as shape-shifting actors! They can assume various roles and behaviors, courtesy of polymorphism. It allows a single object to adjust to diverse situations, diminishing the need for repetitive code. It's like a superhero with distinct costumes for various missions!</li>   
                            </ol>
                        <div class="pro_vs_cons">
                            <h3>Advantages of OOP</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Reusability: No more reinventing the wheel! OOP enables code reuse via inheritance, conserving time and effort.</li>
                            
                                <li> Productivity: OOP serves as your productivity catalyst. With libraries and reusable code, programmers can create new programs rapidly.</li>
                                <li>Upgradability and Scalability: OOP empowers developers to independently enhance system functionalities, making upgrades effortlessly manageable.</li>
                                <li>Interface Descriptions: OOP streamlines external system descriptions using smart message-passing strategies for object communication.</li>
                                <li>Security: Encapsulation and abstraction offer a protective layer for complex code, easing software maintenance and shielding internet protocols.</li>
                                <li>Flexibility: Polymorphism permits functions to adapt to various classes, and objects can share the same interface.</li> 
                
                            </ol>
                            
                            <h3>Disadvantages of OOP:</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Complexity Overload: OOP can sometimes feel like an intricate web of objects, classes, and connections. For smaller projects, this complexity might appear excessive, making you long for the simplicity of alternate programming paradigms.</li>
                                
                                    <li>The Need for Speed: OOP can introduce a bit of a speed bump in terms of performance. All those layers of abstraction and dynamic method calls can slow things down a tad compared to more straightforward approaches.</li>
                                
                                    <li>Memory Hog: Each object you create in OOP carries a little extra baggage in terms of memory. If you're working in resource-constrained environments, this can be a real headache.</li>
                                
                                    <li></li>Verbosity Overload: OOP code can sometimes be a bit wordy. You might need to write more lines of code to do the same thing as you would in other paradigms. It's like writing a novel when a short story would do.
                                
                                    <li>Not Always the One: Let's face it; OOP isn't the hero for every mission. In certain domains like embedded systems or real-time applications, it might be better to suit up with a different programming style.
                                        OOP can be a challenging endeavor, particularly for novices. You'll need to invest considerable effort into understanding concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. But hey, once you've conquered them, you'll feel like a code-wielding superhero!</li>
                                </ol>

                            <p>Let's dive into the exciting world of functional programming languages! Imagine you have a magic wand that can transform things. Functional programming languages are like magic spells for computers!
                                Instead of giving the computer a series of step-by-step instructions like in other types of programming, in functional programming, we give it special functions to work with. 
                                These functions are like little helpers that can take something in, do some magic with it, and give us something back. No messy steps, just pure magic!
                            </p>

                        <img src="images/images_for_programming_lang/logic_based.png" alt="image showing logic based code">
                        <p>Imagine a world where you don't have to tell the computer exactly what to do at every step. Instead, you describe the relationships, rules, and knowledge, and the computer figures it all out!</p>
                            <h3>Principles of Logical Programming Languages:</h3> 
                            <ol>
                                <li>Pattern Matching Mastery: Logical languages excel at pattern matching. You specify a pattern, and the computer hunts down matching solutions.</li>
                                <li>Declarative Style - Say What You Want: In logical languages, you simply declare what you want to happen, and the computer takes care of the rest.</li>
                                <li>Logic-Based Brilliance: Logic is the key. You define facts and rules using logic, letting you express intricate relationships and constraints with ease.</li>
                                <li>Backtracking Brilliance: If a solution doesn't work out, no problem! Logical languages are fantastic at backtracking and exploring different paths to find the right answer.</li>
                            </ol>
